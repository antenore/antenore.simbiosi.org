Some years ago, moved by an impelling need for change, I started to use the [Z shell](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)(Zsh). Coming from the [Bourne-again shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))(aka bash) and the [KornShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell)(ksh), I was at first quite lost, lost as you would be if you start using a vanilla bash without any prompt customization, aliases, colors, custom functions and so forth. In my quest to find quickly the bit of information to setup Zsh for my needs, I discovered [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), an open source framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins and themes. Easy Peasy, I got my Zsh setup in a lightning bolt and forgot about my good intentions of learning the deepest secrets and niceties of Zsh. I'll come back to Oh My Zsh later, but keep in mind that using a framework, while it's extremely useful, it'll hide all the subtle and interesting details.
