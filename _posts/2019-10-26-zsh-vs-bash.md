## TL;DR: Why Zsh Might Be Your Next Shell

The [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (Zsh) offers several compelling advantages over the traditional [Bourne-again shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (Bash):

- **Smart autocompletion** for commands, options, and arguments
- **Shared command history** across all running shells
- **Advanced file globbing** without needing external programs like `find`
- **Floating-point arithmetic** support (Bash only handles integers)
- **Spelling correction** for mistyped commands
- **Themeable prompts** with right-side information that auto-hides
- **Named directories** for custom shortcuts like `~mydir`

> üí° **Pro tip:** For scripting that needs to be portable, stick with POSIX-compliant syntax. Zsh supports all Bash functionality, so your Bash scripts will work without modification.

## A Tale of Two Shells

Some years ago, I switched from Bash to Zsh. At first, I felt lost - just as anyone would when leaving behind years of customized configurations, aliases, and functions. In my search for a quick setup, I discovered [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), an open source framework that made the transition painless with its pre-built themes and plugins.

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | Zsh | Bash |
|---------|-----|------|
| **First Released** | 1990 | 1989 |
| **Default Shell On** | macOS 10.15+, Deepin, GoboLinux | Most Linux distros, macOS 10.3‚Äì10.14 |
| **License** | MIT-style | GPL |
| **Configurability** | Extensive (variables, options, functions, styles) | Basic (variables and options) |
| **Floating Point Math** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Auto-correction** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Syntax Highlighting** | ‚úÖ Via extensions | ‚ùå No |

## Zsh in Action

### Smart Completions and Corrections

The following animation demonstrates Zsh's intelligent completion and auto-correction capabilities:

### Powerful Globbing

Find all Sass files recursively with a simple pattern:

```sh
$ echo **/*\.sass
_sass/base/general.sass _sass/base/helpers.sass _sass/base/syntax.sass _sass/base/variables.sass _sass/components/author.sass _sass/components/disqus.sass _sass/components/footer.sass _sass/components/header.sass _sass/components/nav.sass _sass/components/others.sass _sass/components/pagination.sass _sass/components/related.sass _sass/components/share.sass _sass/components/side-by-side.sass _sass/components/social-links.sass _sass/components/spoiler.sass _sass/pages/home-blog-projects.sass _sass/pages/page.sass _sass/pages/post.sass _sass/pages/tags.sass
```

### Suffix Aliases

Open files directly with associated applications:

```sh
$ alias -s markdown=vim
$ ./_posts/2018-06-14-vim-safe.markdown
# Opens the markdown file directly in vim
```

### Advanced File Filtering

Find files modified more than 100 days ago:

```sh
$ ls -tld *(m+100)
-rw-rw-r-- 1 antenore antenore   117 Jun 16  2018 _config-dev.yml
-rw-rw-r-- 1 antenore antenore   212 Jun 16  2018 Rakefile
# ... more files
```

### Floating-Point Arithmetic

Unlike Bash, Zsh handles floating-point calculations natively:

```sh
$ echo $((0.5 / 0.2))
2.5
```

## Getting Started with Zsh

The easiest way to dive into Zsh is with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh). It provides a rich collection of plugins, themes, and functions with minimal setup effort:

1. Install Zsh (if not already installed)
2. Install Oh My Zsh with their one-line installer
3. Explore the included themes and plugins

> üîç **Tip:** After setting up Oh My Zsh, take some time to read `man zshall` to discover Zsh's full potential.
