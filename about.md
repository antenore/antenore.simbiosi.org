Italian, Swiss, Kyndrol, FLOSS enthusiast, father and husband. I've a
quite strong background in Middleware administration, testing,
automation and system administration (mainly Unix/Linux), cloud administration (OpenShift, AWS)

In the late half of 2014, with [Giovanni Panozzo](https://github.com/giox069),
I became the maintainer of [Remmina](https://remmina.org), a full featured Gtk remote desktop
client. Today, as far as [we know](https://remmina.org/stats/stats.html), it's used by more than
100000 people.

I'm slowly stepping down in my role as maintainer to work on other projects.
