Hey there! I'm Antenore Gatta - an Italian-Swiss FLOSS enthusiast, father, husband, and self-proclaimed fitness fanatic.

By day, I work as a cloud governance and administration wizard, middleware maestro, and automation aficionado - mostly tinkering with Unix/Linux systems. But in my free time, you can find me pounding the pavement for a good run or pumping iron at the gym. Gotta keep this bod in tip-top shape, you know?

Back in 2014, my buddy Giovanni Panozzo and I took over as the maintainers of Remmina, a super handy remote desktop app. To our delight, over 100,000 people now use it worldwide - we must be doing something right! Although I've stepped down from that role, I'm always cooking up new projects to tinker with.

You see, I work for a company called Kyndryl. At Kyndrol, we're always on the lookout for innovative ways to leverage technology to tackle complex challenges. Whether it's cloud, coding, or fitness, I'm passionate about it all and love collaborating with like-minded individuals.

When I'm not geeking out over the latest open-source tech, you'll probably catch me exploring the great outdoors or spending quality time with the fam. Life's too short not to have a little fun, right?

So if you ever want to chat about any of my interests, or maybe even swap a dad joke or two, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to connect!

Catch you on the flip side,
Antenore
