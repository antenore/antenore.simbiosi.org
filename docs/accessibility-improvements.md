# Accessibility Improvements

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to the blog to ensure it's usable by people with disabilities and complies with web accessibility standards.

## Implemented Improvements

- **Smart Alt Text for Gallery Images**: Added logic to detect generic image names (like IMG_1234) and provide more meaningful alt text

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

- **Skip to Content Link**: Added a skip link that allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly to main content

### 4. Screen Reader Support

- **Visually Hidden Elements**: Added a `.visually-hidden` class for content that should be available to screen readers but not visible

- **Semantic HTML**: Used appropriate semantic HTML elements like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.

### 5. CSS and Structure
