## Who I Am

Hey there! I'm Antenore Gatta - an Italian-Swiss cloud governance specialist, AWS enthusiast, FLOSS contributor, and proud father of five.

With over 20 years in tech and the last 6+ years focused on cloud architecture, I currently work as a **Senior Lead Cloud Governance & Security Engineer** at Kyndryl, specializing in building and managing enterprise-scale AWS environments through robust governance frameworks.

## My Expertise

I design and implement complex AWS Organizations structures with a focus on security, compliance, and cost optimization. My core strengths include:

- **Multi-Account Architecture**: Implementing AWS Control Tower, designing account structures, and establishing landing zones for enterprise organizations
- **Security & Governance**: Developing comprehensive Service Control Policies (SCPs), IAM Identity Center solutions, and security frameworks
- **Cost Management**: Implementing CUR 2.0 solutions and creating QuickSight dashboards for cost analysis and optimization
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automating cloud infrastructure using CloudFormation and Terraform

In addition to my cloud expertise, I maintain a strong foundation in Linux/UNIX systems, containerization (OpenShift), and CI/CD practices gained from my previous systems engineering roles.

## Certifications

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (2022-2025)
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (2022-2025)
- Red Hat OpenShift Administration (DO180/280, DO425)
- IBM Professional Development (Strategic OSS Committer, Architecture)

## Open Source Contributions

From 2014 to 2023, I served as lead maintainer of [Remmina](https://gitlab.com/Remmina/Remmina), an open-source remote desktop client serving over 150,000 users globally. Our team reviewed 8,000+ commits from 200+ contributors, implementing comprehensive CI/CD workflows and enhancing protocol support.

I remain active in open source communities, focusing on system administration tools and infrastructure automation projects.

## Beyond Technology

When I'm not architecting cloud solutions or contributing to open source, I'm dedicated to fitness and powerlifting. This balance of technical problem-solving and physical discipline helps me maintain perspective and energy.

I believe in continuously expanding my skills, and I'm currently focusing on integrating AI capabilities with cloud architecture to enhance governance and security models.
