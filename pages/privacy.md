# Privacy Policy

Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit {{ site.url }} (the "Site").

## Personal Information We Collect

We collect minimal personal information to provide and improve our services. The information we collect includes:

### Google Analytics

This Site uses Google Analytics to help us understand how visitors interact with our content. Google Analytics collects standard internet log information and visitor behavior information. This information is processed in a way that does not identify individual users. We do not make any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.

The data collected includes:
- Pages visited and time spent on the Site
- Browser type and operating system
- Approximate geographic location (country/city level)
- Referral source

Google Analytics stores this information on servers in the United States. Google may transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf.

### Comment System

When you submit a comment on our blog posts, the comment is processed through GitLab as a merge request. This process involves:

1. Your comment and any personal information you provide (such as name and email) is submitted to GitLab
2. A merge request is created in our GitLab repository
3. When the comment is approved and merged, an email notification is sent via Amazon SES

We only collect the information you voluntarily provide in your comments. This may include your name, email address, and the content of your comment.

### Email Notifications

When comments are approved, email notifications are sent through Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). These emails only contain the information necessary to notify you about your comment being published.

## Cookies

This Site uses cookies to enhance your browsing experience. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to the owners of the site.

We use cookies for the following purposes:
- To enable Google Analytics tracking (these cookies are only set after you consent)
- To remember your cookie consent preferences

## Your Rights

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.

Additionally, if you are a European resident, we note that we are processing your information to fulfill our legitimate business interests as described above. Please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.

## Data Retention

When you leave a comment on the Site, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For Google Analytics, user and event data is retained for 26 months.

## Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
